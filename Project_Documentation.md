##  EventHive ‚Äì Full Stack Event Management & Assignment Platform

# Project Overview -
    EventHive is a full-stack event management platform where users can request personal or professional events (like weddings, birthdays, corporate meetups), and organizers can apply to manage them. An admin reviews the organizer applications for each event and assigns the most suitable one. The platform supports role-based access, event workflows, and a modern React + Tailwind frontend.

    This project is designed to showcase real-world coordination, multi-role workflows, and your ability to build scalable systems from scratch ‚Äî both backend and frontend.
